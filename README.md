## Overview

This project addresses automated defect detection on metal surfaces — a core challenge in industrial quality control and a key capability for next-generation intelligent manufacturing systems. We benchmark three machine learning approaches on the **NEU Metal Surface Defects Dataset**, comparing deep learning (CNN) against classical computer vision pipelines (SVM with HOG features, Random Forest with HOG features) across six defect categories.

The work demonstrates the full pipeline from raw image ingestion and augmentation to model training, hyperparameter search, evaluation, and visual analysis — skills directly applicable to industrial inspection, autonomous operation, and visual asset analysis in energy and manufacturing domains.

## Problem Statement

Metal surfaces can develop six distinct defect types during production. Manual inspection is slow, subjective, and unscalable. This project builds and compares automated classifiers that can identify defect type from grayscale surface images, enabling real-time quality assurance on production lines.

## Methods

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A custom CNN built with TensorFlow/Keras:

| Layer | Output Shape | Parameters |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Conv2D (32 filters, 3×3) + ReLU | 198×198×32 | 896 |
| MaxPooling2D | 99×99×32 | 0 |
| Conv2D (64 filters, 3×3) + ReLU | 97×97×64 | 18,496 |
| MaxPooling2D | 48×48×64 | 0 |
| Conv2D (128 filters, 3×3) + ReLU | 46×46×128 | 73,856 |
| MaxPooling2D | 23×23×128 | 0 |
| Flatten | 67,712 | 0 |
| Dense (256) + Dropout | 256 | 17,334,528 |
| Dense (6, softmax) | 6 | 1,542 |
| **Total** | | **~17.4M params** |

**Training details:**
- Optimizer: Adam, Loss: Categorical Cross-Entropy
- Data augmentation: shear (0.2), horizontal flip, rescaling (1/255)
- Callbacks: ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping (patience=10), ReduceLROnPlateau

### 2. SVM with HOG Features
- Feature extraction: **Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)** via `skimage.feature`
- Classifier: **SVC** with RBF kernel (`C=10`, `gamma='scale'`)
- Training on combined train + validation sets

### 3. Random Forest with HOG Features
- Same HOG feature pipeline as SVM
- `RandomForestClassifier` with hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/metal-defect-detection.git
cd metal-defect-detection
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Download the dataset
You need a Kaggle API key (`kaggle.json`) placed in your Google Drive or local `~/.kaggle/` directory.

```bash
kaggle datasets download -d fantacher/neu-metal-surface-defects-data
unzip neu-metal-surface-defects-data.zip -d data/
```

### 4. Run the notebook
Open `CVproject.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab and update the dataset path variables at the top of Section 2:

```python
train_dir = 'data/NEU Metal Surface Defects Data/train'
test_dir  = 'data/NEU Metal Surface Defects Data/test'
valid_dir = 'data/NEU Metal Surface Defects Data/valid'
```

## Results

| Model | Test Accuracy | Test Loss |
|-------|:------------:|:---------:|
| **CNN** | **97.22%** | 0.100 |
| SVM (HOG + RBF kernel, C=10) | 86.11% | — |
| Random Forest (HOG + GridSearchCV) | 86.11% | — |

### CNN Training Summary
- Trained for 25 epochs on Google Colab (T4 GPU)
- Best validation accuracy: **100%** (epoch 25, val_loss: 0.022)
- Optimizer: Adam; learning rate reduced to 2e-4 at epoch 21 via ReduceLROnPlateau
- Final training accuracy: ~97.6%

### Classical Models
Both SVM and Random Forest used HOG features extracted from grayscale images.  
SVM was trained on the combined train+validation set; Random Forest was tuned with GridSearchCV  
(`n_estimators=200, max_depth=20, min_samples_split=10, min_samples_leaf=2, max_features='sqrt'`).

### Key Takeaway
The CNN outperforms both classical approaches by ~11 percentage points on the test set,  
demonstrating the advantage of learned spatial features over hand-crafted HOG descriptors  
for fine-grained texture-based defect classification.

## Relevance to Industrial Applications

This project aligns directly with real-world needs in automated industrial inspection:

- **Defect detection** — classifying surface anomalies mirrors inspection tasks in energy infrastructure, turbine components, and manufacturing QA
- **Feature extraction pipeline** — HOG-based features are lightweight and interpretable, suitable for edge deployment
- **Deep learning vs. classical trade-off** — the comparison informs architectural decisions for resource-constrained vs. accuracy-critical deployment scenarios
- **Scalable methodology** — the pipeline generalizes to other visual asset analysis tasks (corrosion, fatigue cracks, weld quality)
